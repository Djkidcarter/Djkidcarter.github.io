    <p>When I watch the English Premier league, i support the Gunners of Arsenal. When I was young, the team had many famous French players such Henry, Pires, Vieira or Petit. The manager was also from France, Arsene Wenger.This fact pushed me to follow this team. The style of play of that team is all about attacking and playing an entertaining type of football.</p>
