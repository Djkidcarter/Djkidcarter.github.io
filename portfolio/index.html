         <p>
           I am Kaisa. I got my makeup and hairstylist certification in 2006 in Finland from TI makeup centre. I have been working in the makeup and hair scene in many be different assignments in Finland and mainly in the UK for the past 10 years.
I have worked as a theatre makeup artist, hairstylist and a makeup and hair designer for the Rujo theatre productions.<br>

I have also worked as a wedding makeup and hair stylist, mainly in the UK with the lovely Jenna West makeup. We have covered multiple weddings together and I love making people feel beautiful in their own skin, enhancing the beautiful features they have.
My trademark makeup is natural makeup, but I can also do glam. <br>
With theatre makeup and hair love to throw myself into the artistic world and help create the best outcome with the director and the rest of the production team!
