        I am Kaisa. I got my makeup and hairstylist certification in 2006<br> in Finland from TI makeup centre. I have been working in the makeup<br> and hair scene in many different assignments in Finland and mainly in the UK for the past 10 years.
        I have worked as a theatre makeup artist, hairstylist and a makeup and hair designer for the Rujo theatre productions.<br><br>

        I have also worked as a wedding makeup and hair stylist, mainly in the UK with the lovely Jenna West makeup. We have covered multiple weddings together and I love making people feel beautiful in their own skin, enhancing the beautiful features they have.
        My trademark makeup is natural makeup, but I can also do glam.<br><br>
        
        With theatre makeup and hair, I love to throw myself into the artistic world and help create the best outcome with the director and the rest of the production team!
