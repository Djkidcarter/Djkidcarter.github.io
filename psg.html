    <p>I was born in Paris so I naturaly support PSG since being a kid. I remember going to the Parc de Princes for the first time when I was 8. The team looked very different back then. The arrival of new investors back in 2012 has changed the financial power and the attractivity of the club. It is now one of the top football club in Europe competing every seasons for the champion's league.</p>
